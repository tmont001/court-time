## Checkpoint 21A-0 — Pre-launch mobile admin/pro event duration usability fix

**Status: Complete ✓ — manual QA passed; pnpm tsc and pnpm build pass**

### What was fixed

The admin/pro event creation sheet (`CreateEventSheet.tsx`, Step 2) previously used
a plain `<input type="number">` for duration. On mobile this produced a poor
experience: no quick presets, a numeric spinner that was hard to tap accurately, and
no real-time "ends at" feedback on selection.

This fix is scoped strictly to the mobile usability of the duration field in
admin/pro event creation. Member court booking duration behavior (`CalendarShell.tsx`)
is unchanged.

### Files changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/app/(app)/calendar/CreateEventSheet.tsx` | Replaced `<input type="number">` with preset pill buttons (30/45/60/90/120 min) plus a Custom mode that reveals a `inputMode="numeric"` text input. Added `DURATION_PRESETS` constant, `isCustomDuration` and `customDurationText` state, `handleCustomDuration` handler, `customDurationValid` derived value. Updated `selectType` to reset duration mode when an event type is chosen. Continue button gated on `customDurationValid`. |

No migrations. No RLS changes. No RPC changes. No changes to member court booking.

### New duration UX

- **Six pill buttons** on Step 2: 30 min / 45 min / 60 min / 90 min / 120 min / Custom.
- The pill matching the selected event type's `default_duration_minutes` is pre-highlighted.
  If the default is not in the preset list (e.g. 75 min), Custom mode is pre-activated.
- Tapping a preset sets the duration immediately; the "ends at" label updates in real time.
- Tapping **Custom** reveals a compact text input pre-filled with the current duration.
  - Uses `type="text" inputMode="numeric"` for a clean numeric keyboard on mobile.
  - Inline "Enter a whole number." error shown when text is non-empty and invalid.
  - Continue button remains disabled until the value is a valid positive integer.
- Admin/pro event duration is not restricted to the preset list — Custom accepts any
  positive whole number, preserving existing admin/pro flexibility.

### Manual QA results

- [x] **Admin — 60 min preset (mobile):** Opened create-event sheet as Admin; "60 min"
      pill pre-highlighted on a 60-minute default event type; tapped the pill; "ends at"
      label updated correctly; proceeded through courts → confirm; event created with
      correct duration.
- [x] **Admin — 90 min preset (mobile):** Tapped "90 min" pill; "ends at" updated;
      event created with duration 90 min.
- [x] **Admin — Custom duration (mobile):** Tapped Custom; numeric input appeared
      pre-filled; entered 75; "ends at" updated to reflect 75 min; completed creation;
      duration confirmed correct.
- [x] **Empty/invalid Custom input disables Continue:** Cleared custom field; Continue
      stayed disabled; typed "abc"; "Enter a whole number." error shown; Continue stayed
      disabled. Cleared and typed a valid integer; Continue enabled.
- [x] **Pro event creation:** Pro role opens create-event sheet; same preset pills
      present; behavior identical to Admin.
- [x] **Desktop regression:** Preset pills render and wrap correctly on desktop; Custom
      input usable with keyboard; full step flow (event type → date/time → courts →
      confirm) completes without visual breakage.
- [x] **Member court booking unchanged:** Member booking sheet still shows exactly
      four pills — 30 min / 60 min / 90 min / 120 min — with no 45 min option and no
      Custom pill. Behavior identical to Phase 20D-B.

### Deferred UX note

**Future UX polish (post-pilot):** Evaluate whether admin court reservation creation,
court blocking/maintenance creation, and event creation should share a more consistent
mobile creation pattern after pilot feedback is collected. The three flows currently
use different field layouts and input patterns that could benefit from a unified
bottom-sheet component pass during a post-pilot UX polish phase.
